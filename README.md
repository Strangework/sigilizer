sigilizer
=========

Sigilizer is a small set of Python scripts used to generate sigils.
Sigils are stylised icons representing ideas and intentions. There is no de-facto system for creating sigils; any arbitrary system is suitable.

The Sigilizer scripts do not use a specific system, instead it allows for geometric transformations of 2d shapes according to the users specifications.
